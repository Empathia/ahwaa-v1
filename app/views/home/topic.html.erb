    <p>I am nervous about coming out to my parents. they are catholic, and very religious, and tell me it is very bad to be "homosexual".</p>
    <p>And i currently live with them, so i am scared that they'll treat me differently. Once, my mom eavesdropped on a phone call i had with a boy, and she thought I was gay. I told her no, but that was because she was crying. That day made me want to hide it from her, but i know telling her would be best. -Since i am in a relationship with a boy.</p>
    <p>So what best way would i be able to "come out" to my parents about being bisexual? Please and thank you.</p>
    <p>This may seem like a really bad question but please hear me out.</p>
    <p>I'm 17, I've never had boyfriend and I'm only kind of out of the closet. I'm starting to look for a boyfriend and I'm having trouble finding any gay guys let alone one who would want to date me. I'm afraid that I don't have any traits that would make someone think I'm gay.</p>
    <p>Everyone who I have come out to is always like "omg really?! I would have never guessed." and although in a lot of situations that is a good thing for safety it doesn't help when I'm looking for a boyfriend. Is there anything I can do to you know, kinda look like I'm gay?</p>
    <p>I currently wear jeans, tshirt and sneakers. I don't act very feminine. I'm 6 feet tall and rather large. Any help would be great THX.</p>
